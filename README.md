# hello-world
First repository for introductory lessons and hello world exercises.

Hi I'm Ananya.

If there's ever a virtual reality game like Sword Art Online or Hardcore Leveling Warrior
count me in. Also I want to learn how to code artificial intelligence for robots.
And I want to check out the SpaceX station they make on Mars. And I want a bioluminescent
cat. I know y'all are holding out on those biogenetically engineered pets so make it happen!

Besides that I'm a pretty ordinary girl that likes playing video games
and reading webcomics and I want to figure out what I want to actually
do with programming. Wish me luck strangers.
